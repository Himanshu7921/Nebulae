## Overview

**Nebulae** is an autonomous multi-agent AI research framework built to handle complex research and analytical workflows—from data retrieval to report generation—with reasoning, reflection, and learning capabilities.

Think of **Nebulae** as an AI-powered research lab capable of planning, analyzing, writing, and self-improving. It demonstrates advanced engineering principles in **multi-agent orchestration**, **retrieval-augmented reasoning**, and **adaptive learning systems**.

---

## Concept

Nebulae enables users to provide a **research goal** or **analytical objective**, which it autonomously decomposes and executes:

1. Plans tasks and assigns them to specialized agents.
2. Retrieves and summarizes relevant information.
3. Analyzes data and generates visual insights.
4. Writes reports in a professional format.
5. Critiques and refines its own outputs.
6. Learns from user feedback for continual improvement.

---

## Example Scenario

**User Prompt**

> “Generate a research report on the impact of AI on global job markets, using data from 2020–2024, visual trends, and predictions.”

**Nebulae Workflow**

1. Decomposes the task into subtasks: retrieval → summarization → analysis → writing → critique.
2. **Research Agent** fetches relevant data using the custom RAG framework, [RetrievalMind](https://github.com/Himanshu7921/RetrievalMind).
3. **Summarizer Agent** condenses content into concise internal notes.
4. **Data Analysis Agent** extracts, processes, and visualizes trends.
5. **Writer Agent** composes a structured, referenced report.
6. **Critic Agent** reviews for clarity, factual correctness, and logical flow.
7. **Memory Agent** stores feedback and adapts future performance.

## Powered by RetrievalMind

Nebulae’s research capabilities are powered by **[RetrievalMind](https://github.com/Himanshu7921/RetrievalMind)**, a custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed to efficiently search, extract, and contextualize data from both structured and unstructured sources.

**Key advantages include:**

* Intelligent retrieval from multiple document types and APIs.
* Contextual grounding for factual accuracy.
* Dynamic updates through continuous learning and reflection.

---

## Key Highlights

* **Autonomous Research Flow** – Multi-agent orchestration from data retrieval to reporting.
* **RAG-Enhanced Reasoning** – Integrated with the custom **RetrievalMind** framework.
* **Self-Review System** – Built-in critic for automatic quality assurance.
* **Long-Term Memory** – Learns and adapts from prior tasks and feedback.
* **Human Feedback Integration** – Continuous refinement via human-in-the-loop review.
* **Extensible Architecture** – Modular agent design for flexible expansion.
