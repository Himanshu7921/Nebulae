# Nebulae – Architectural Overview

**Version:** Draft 0.1  
**Author:** Himanshu Singh  
**Last Updated:** October 2025

## 1. Introduction

**Nebulae** is an autonomous multi-agent AI research framework designed to simulate a human-like research workflow.  
It orchestrates multiple specialized agents to collaboratively handle end-to-end analytical processes — including information retrieval, data analysis, synthesis, writing, and critique.

This document provides a high-level architectural overview of Nebulae’s structure, interaction flow, and planned integrations.

## 2. Core Objectives

- Enable fully autonomous research execution from a single input goal.
- Integrate retrieval-augmented reasoning using the **RetrievalMind** framework.
- Support modular agent addition and tool registry extension.
- Retain long-term context and user feedback for adaptive intelligence.

## 3. High-Level Architecture

**Core Layers (Planned):**
1. **Agent Orchestration Layer** – Handles goal decomposition, task scheduling, and agent communication.
2. **Knowledge Retrieval Layer** – Integrates with *RetrievalMind* for dynamic data access.
3. **Computation & Analysis Layer** – Provides analytical and visualization capabilities.
4. **Persistence Layer** – Manages memory, knowledge storage, and feedback.
5. **Interface Layer (Upcoming)** – Planned dashboard and API endpoints for interactive use.

*(Detailed system design to be finalized — this section will evolve with implementation progress.)*

## 4. Agent Communication Model

Each agent operates as an isolated, callable entity following a message-passing model.  
Agents communicate using standardized data objects containing:
- `task_id`
- `context`
- `input_data`
- `response`
- `metadata`

Planned orchestration backbone: **LangChain / MCP (Model Context Protocol)**.

## 5. Knowledge Integration (RetrievalMind)

Nebulae connects directly with [RetrievalMind](https://github.com/Himanshu7921/RetrievalMind) — a custom RAG system responsible for:
- Query expansion and contextual retrieval.
- Source validation and ranking.
- Knowledge embedding and caching.

---

## 6. Extensibility

Nebulae’s modular agent system is built to:
- Allow rapid addition of new specialized agents.
- Register or unregister agent capabilities dynamically.
- Extend via configuration or code-level customization.

---

## 7. Security and Reliability (Upcoming Section)

Future considerations will include:
- Safe tool execution environments.
- Rate limiting for API calls.
- Isolation between agent contexts.

---

## 8. TODO (Development Tasks)

- [ ] Finalize communication backbone (LangChain / MCP).
- [ ] Define internal data object schema.
- [ ] Document memory persistence strategy.
- [ ] Integrate initial feedback learning module.
- [ ] Draft API layer specifications for upcoming dashboard.
